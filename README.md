# BoggleSolitaire
My Attempt at turning the Classic word game into a single player video game.

Key features:

 - TRIE SEARCH ALGORITHM:  the game utilises a special data structure called a TRIE to efficiently find all the available words on the board. 
 
 - DIFFUCULTY LEVELS:  
 
 - AUTOMATIC DIFICULTY SCALING: upon some playtesting. one problem I found with Boggle as a single player game was that depending on how the dice fall, finding words on the board could be easy or difficult.
